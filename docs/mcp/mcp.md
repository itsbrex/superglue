description: "Universal MCP tool for reliable agent workflows across any API"
---

Turn any API into workflows so your agents can get things done reliably.

**superglue MCP** provides a universal tool that lets agents build reliable, validated workflows for any app, database or API, simply by requesting them in natural language.

<Info>
  MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the easiest way to give AI agents access to external tools and data sources. superglue provides a universal MCP server that connects to any API.

## How superglue MCP Works

Instead of building separate MCP tools for each API, superglue provides one powerful MCP server that:

1. **Merges multiple endpoints and APIs into custom workflows**
2. **Exposes them via one server** that abstracts away endpoints and API calls
3. **Acts like a repository pattern** that stays stable even as upstream APIs or mappings change

### What You Can Build

## Setup for Claude Desktop

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://superglue.cloud/files/mcp.mp4" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Get your API key from [app.superglue.cloud](https://app.superglue.cloud) or use your self-hosted instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Claude Desktop">
    Add to your Claude Desktop MCP settings (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "superglue": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp.superglue.ai",
            "--header",
            "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
          ],
          "env": {
            "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer YOUR_SUPERGLUE_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Self-hosting?** Replace `https://mcp.superglue.ai` with `http://<your-superglue-host>:<port>/mcp` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/mcp`)
    </Tip>
    <Warning>
      The `AUTH_HEADER` format is used because Cursor/Claude Desktop doesn't allow spaces in the args array, but does allow them in environment variables.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should see "superglue" connected in the MCP status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Framework Integration

### LangChain

You can use superglue with LangChain agents that support MCP:

```python
from langchain_community.tools import MCPTool
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent

# Initialize MCP connection to superglue
superglue_tools = MCPTool.from_server(
    server_command=["npx", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.superglue.ai", "--header", "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"]
)

# Add to your agent
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[superglue_tools],
    llm=your_llm,
    agent_type="conversational-react-description"
)
```

### CrewAI

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import MCPTool

# Create superglue tool
superglue = MCPTool(
    server_command=["npx", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.superglue.ai", "--header", "Authorization:Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"]
)

# Add to your agent
data_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Integration Specialist",
    tools=[superglue],
    goal="Integrate and orchestrate data from multiple APIs"
)
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "superglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.superglue.ai",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer YOUR_SUPERGLUE_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Agent Conversations

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://superglue.cloud/files/hubspot.mp4" />

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Analysis">
    **Human:** "Analyze my business performance across Stripe, HubSpot, and Google Analytics"

    **Agent:** "I'll help you analyze your business performance across those platforms. Let me gather the data from each source and create a comprehensive analysis.

    First, let me find the available integrations..."

    _[Agent uses superglue_find_integrations]_

    "Great\! I can see you have Stripe, HubSpot, and Google Analytics connected. Now I'll build a workflow to gather data from all three sources..."

    _[Agent uses superglue_build_and_run_workflow]_

    "Here's your business performance analysis: [detailed results with revenue trends, lead conversion, traffic patterns]"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multi-Step Workflow">
    **Human:** "When someone subscribes to my Stripe plan, add them to HubSpot and send a Slack notification"

    **Agent:** "I'll create an automated workflow that triggers when someone subscribes. Let me build this integration...

    _[Agent uses superglue_build_and_run_workflow with webhook setup]_

    This workflow will:

    1. Monitor Stripe for new subscriptions
    2. Automatically add new subscribers to HubSpot as contacts
    3. Send a formatted Slack notification to your team

    Would you like me to save this workflow for ongoing use?"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Integration">
    **Human:** "Connect to my company's internal inventory API and get current stock levels"

    **Agent:** "I'll need to add your internal API as a new integration first. Let me set that up...

    _[Agent uses superglue_create_integration]_

    I've added your inventory API. What authentication does it require? API key, OAuth, or something else?"

    **Human:** "It uses an API key in the Authorization header"

    **Agent:** "Perfect\! Now let me fetch your current stock levels...

    _[Agent uses superglue_build_and_run_workflow]_

    Here are your current stock levels: [formatted inventory data]"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    When a workflow works well, save it for reuse:

    > "This worked perfectly\! Save it as 'weekly-revenue-report' so I can run it regularly."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Authentication & Session Management

The superglue MCP server uses key-based authentication and session management:

- **Authentication**: All requests require a valid superglue API key in the Authorization header
- **Sessions**: MCP interactions are session-based to maintain context across requests

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP Server Not Connecting" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** Claude says "superglue not available" or MCP status shows disconnected

    **Solutions:**

    1. Verify `mcp-remote` is available: `npx mcp-remote --version`
    2. Check your API key is correct in the `AUTH_HEADER` environment variable
    3. Test the endpoint: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://mcp.superglue.ai`
    4. Restart Claude Desktop completely
    5. Check the logs: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-*.log`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Workflow Building Fails" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Symptoms:** Agent says it can't understand the integration or API calls fail

    **Solutions:**

    1. Be more specific about what data you want
    2. Check if the integration exists: ask agent to "find integrations for [service]"
    3. Verify your credentials are still valid in the superglue dashboard
    4. Try breaking complex requests into smaller steps
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues" icon="key">
    **Symptoms:** API calls return 401 or 403 errors

    **Solutions:**

    1. Check if integration API keys have expired or been revoked
    2. Verify the integration has the right permissions/scopes
    3. Test credentials directly with the API provider
